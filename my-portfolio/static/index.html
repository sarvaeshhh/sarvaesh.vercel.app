          <div class="section-content">
            <p class="about-text">Hi, I’m Sarvaesh!<br>
                A Python developer, BI analyst, and professional overthinker based in Coimbatore. I’m on a mission to find problems I can solve (and maybe create a few along the way—just kidding!). I began my professional journey in August 2024 at Verticurl (an Ogilvy Company), where I’ve been contributing my part to building the RD Tool for Ogilvy One. Think of me as a few bricks in that whole building—small but essential!

                I’m fluent in Python, Power BI, Tableau, HTML, and CSS, and I’m currently exploring FastAPI and Next.js (let’s just say we’re in the “getting to know each other” phase). I also use AI tools like Cursor, Cline, and Roo-code to help me code faster and smarter. (Yes, I’m cheating, but it’s the future, so I call it “being efficient.”)
                
                I’m a B.Sc. Data Science graduate from Sri Krishna Arts and Science College and currently pursuing my M.Sc. Data Science at VIT Online. I believe in learning by doing, which is why I’m always building something—whether it’s useful or just a glorified to-do list.
                
                When I’m not coding, you’ll find me:
                
                Playing PES Mobile (because real football is too much cardio).
                
                Chasing a ball on turfs every Saturday evening (it’s a ritual, like brushing my teeth, but sweatier).
                
                Reliving my glory days as a professional cricket player by bowling (or trying to) for my office team in Red Tennis Cricket. I’m a bit slow, but I make up for it with enthusiasm!
                
                I’m also the brains behind Aadukalam, a turf finder website that started as my college capstone project. It’s like Tinder, but for turfs and timeslots (no swiping, though). I’m incrementally improving it because, well, Rome wasn’t built in a day, and neither is my website.
                
                Here’s a little more about me:
                I prioritize myself. Disappointing myself? Not on my watch. (Unless it’s about finishing that one Netflix series instead of coding—then maybe.)
                
                I live by the Tamil proverb, “யாதும் ஊரே யாவரும் கேளிர்”—the world is one family. Yes, I’m that deep. No, I don’t charge for wisdom.
                
                And my mantra? “There is only one god, and his name is Death. And there is only one thing we say to Death: ‘Not today.’” (Thanks, Syrio Forel, for the life advice. I use it daily, especially when debugging code.)
                
                I’m a curious, funny, and occasionally messy guy who thrives on collaboration, innovation, and recognition. My short-term goal is to build as many projects as possible, and my long-term goal is to make learning a habit. I’d love to work in the sports field someday because, let’s be honest, sports is the best thing ever.
                
                If you’re still reading this, you’re awesome. Check out my projects, and if you’re feeling extra nice, connect with me on LinkedIn. Let’s create something amazing together—or at least laugh while trying!</p>
